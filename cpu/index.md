# CPU cores

## 8051

The first MCU/CPU that was ever used in MStar's chips,
as before that, you had to use an external MCU to control their display controller chips.

It's also used in various chip subsystems (like [PM51](../ip/pm51.md));
and in various utlility chips like touchscreens, demodulators...

## OpenRISC

The [OpenRISC](https://openrisc.io) architecture, or specifically, OpenRISC 1000 "or1k" core,
althrough this does not imply that they didn't made a compatible core themselves.

It's mostly seen in various IP blocks, rather than being a housekeeping core (i.e. the main core).

## AEON

AEON, "BEON", "R2", "RISC32", whatever it could be called, is an custom 32-bit architecture that is heavily based off OpenRISC,
where the changes basically were done in the instruction encoding scheme, as well as any other change that might follow because of that.
